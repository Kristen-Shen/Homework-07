# Homework-07

### This repository includes two projects, both using pandas to analyze and clean data.

#### The first folder `01-beers` analyzed the file `craftcans.csv` (included in the folder) 

#### `craftcans.csv` includes data about information about beers, their brewery, location, etc.

#### In this project, I addressed various queires and made a few charts for visualization.

#### The second folder `02-dogs` analyzed multiple files, including `boro_population.csv`, `NYC_Dog_Licenses_Current_as_of_4-28-2016.xlsx`, `zipcodes-neighborhoods.csv`(all included in the folder)

#### `NYC_Dog_Licenses_Current_as_of_4-28-2016.xlsx` includes information about licensed dogs, which is a [FOIL request to New York City] (https://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-city-17/pet-licensing-data-for-new-york-city-23826/).
#### `boro_population.csv` and zipcodes-neighborhoods.csv` include geographical information about New York City such as boroughs, zip codes, etc.

#### In this project, I merged these three files to address multiple complex queries and make charts to visualize licensed dogs in the city.

### Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestion!
